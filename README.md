# UFOs

## Overview of Project

Dana,who is a data journalist tasked from a client to create an webpage and dynamic table with UFO sightings data stored as a JavaScript array. Now, the client wanted more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria(such as:the city, state, country, and shape) at the same time. The table was created by using JavaScript, to make this table fully dynamic we create filters which will react to user input and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. And,Bootstrap were used to customize the asthetics of the webpage.
