# UFOs

## Overview of Project

Dana,who is a data journalist tasked from a client to create an webpage and dynamic table with UFO sightings data stored as a JavaScript array. Now, the client wanted more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria(such as:the city, state, country, and shape) at the same time. The table was created by using JavaScript, to make this table fully dynamic we create filters which will react to user input and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. And,Bootstrap were used to customize the asthetics of the webpage.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to create a dynamic webpage using JavaScript, CSS, HTML and Bootstrap that represents UFO sightings data by allowing users to filter for the date,city, state, country, and shape.

## Resources

## Summary

### Drawback

-The major drawback of this webpage is filtering can be done only for certain criteria like the given city,state,date and shape. If user input any other city, which is not listed, it returns an empty table.

### Recommendations

-There should be a search criteria where user can input specific range of date UFO sightings has been reported.

-There should be a cloumn for the latest UFO sighting has been reported and the details of the report.

-Adding a map to present the data could be more user-friendly.
